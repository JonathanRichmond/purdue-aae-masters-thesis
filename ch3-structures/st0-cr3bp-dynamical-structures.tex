\chapter{CR3BP DYNAMICAL STRUCTURES}

As mentioned in the previous chapter, there is no analytical solution to the CR3BP. Instead,
trajectories are propagated using numerical methods. To find existing dynamical structures in the
model, such as periodic orbits and invariant manifolds, and obtain corresponding initial conditions
for propagation, various numerical techniques are applied. These include differential corrections,
natural parameter continuation, eigen decomposition, and Poincar\'e mapping.
