\chapter{CR3BP DYNAMICAL STRUCTURES}

As mentioned previously, there is not an analytical solution to the CR3BP. Instead,
trajectories are propagated with numerical methods. Various numerical techniques are applied to
find existing dynamical structures in the model, such as periodic orbits and invariant manifolds,
and obtain corresponding initial conditions for propagation. These include differential
corrections, natural parameter continuation, eigen-decomposition, and Poincar\'e mapping.
