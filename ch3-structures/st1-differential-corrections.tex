\section{Differential Corrections}
Differential corrections are used to compute solutions in targeting problems that satisfy the
provided constraints on the initial condition and the trajectory arc. To do so, it is necessary to
be able to relate downstream states to the initial condition.

\subsection{State Transition Matrix}
The state transition matrix (STM) relates variations in an initial state, $\qbar_{0}=\qbar(t_{0})$,
to variations in a downstream state $\qbar(t)$. Starting from a first-order Taylor series expansion
about the baseline trajectory arc, the linear variational equation is derived:
\begin{equation}
    \partial\qbardot(t)=A(t)\partial\qbar(t),
    \label{eq:linearvariational}
\end{equation}
where $A(t)$ is the Jacobian matrix for the equations of motion with respect to the state at time
$t$. A full derivation for the CR3BP $A(t)$ matrix can be found in Zimovan, but the result is given
here\cite{Zimovan:2017}:
\begin{equation}
    A(t)=\begin{bmatrix}    \frac{\partial x}{\partial x_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial x}{\partial y_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial x}{\partial z_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial x}{\partial \xdot_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial x}{\partial \ydot_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial x}{\partial \zdot_{0}}       \\
                            \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial y}{\partial y_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial y}{\partial z_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial y}{\partial \xdot_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial y}{\partial \ydot_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial y}{\partial \zdot_{0}}       \\
                            \frac{\partial z}{\partial x_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial z}{\partial y_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial z}{\partial z_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial z}{\partial \xdot_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial z}{\partial \ydot_{0}}       &   \frac{\partial z}{\partial \zdot_{0}}       \\
                            \frac{\partial \xdot}{\partial x_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \xdot}{\partial y_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \xdot}{\partial z_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \xdot}{\partial \xdot_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \xdot}{\partial \ydot_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \xdot}{\partial \zdot_{0}}   \\
                            \frac{\partial \ydot}{\partial x_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \ydot}{\partial y_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \ydot}{\partial z_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \ydot}{\partial \xdot_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \ydot}{\partial \ydot_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \ydot}{\partial \zdot_{0}}   \\
                            \frac{\partial \zdot}{\partial x_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \zdot}{\partial y_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \zdot}{\partial z_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \zdot}{\partial \xdot_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \zdot}{\partial \ydot_{0}}   &   \frac{\partial \zdot}{\partial \zdot_{0}}   \end{bmatrix}
        =\begin{bmatrix}    0                                       &   0                                       &   0                                       &   1   &   0   &   0   \\
                            0                                       &   0                                       &   0                                       &   0   &   1   &   0   \\
                            0                                       &   0                                       &   0                                       &   0   &   0   &   1   \\
                            \frac{\partial U}{\partial x\partial x} &   \frac{\partial U}{\partial x\partial y} &   \frac{\partial U}{\partial x\partial z} &   0   &   2n  &   0   \\
                            \frac{\partial U}{\partial y\partial x} &   \frac{\partial U}{\partial y\partial y} &   \frac{\partial U}{\partial y\partial z} &   -2n &   0   &   0   \\
                            \frac{\partial U}{\partial z\partial x} &   \frac{\partial U}{\partial z\partial y} &   \frac{\partial U}{\partial z\partial z} &   0   &   0   &   0   \end{bmatrix},
                            \label{eq:variationalJacobian}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial x\partial x}=1-\frac{1-\mu}{d^{3}}-\frac{\mu}{r^{3}}+\frac{3(1-\mu)(x+\mu)^{2}}{d^{5}}+\frac{3\mu(x-1+\mu)^{2}}{r^{5}},
    \label{eq:partialUpartialxx}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial x\partial y}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial y\partial x}=\frac{3(1-\mu)(x+\mu)y}{d^{5}}+\frac{3\mu(x-1+\mu)y}{r^{5}},
    \label{eq:partialUpartialxy}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial x\partial z}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial z\partial x}=\frac{3(1-\,u)(x+\mu)z}{d^{5}}+\frac{3\mu(x-1+\mu)z}{r^{5}},
    \label{eq:partialUpartialxz}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial y\partial y}=1-\frac{1-\mu}{d^{3}}-\frac{\mu}{r^{3}}+\frac{3(1-\mu)y^{2}}{d^{5}}+\frac{3\mu y^{2}}{r^{5}},
    \label{eq:partialUpartialyy}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial y\partial z}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial z\partial y}=\frac{3(1-\mu)yz}{d^{5}}+\frac{3\mu yz}{r^{5}},
    \label{eq:partialUpartialyz}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial z\partial z}=-\frac{1-\mu}{d^{3}}-\frac{\mu}{r^{3}}+\frac{3(1-\mu)z^{2}}{d^{5}}+\frac{3\mu z^{2}}{r^{5}}.
    \label{eq:partialUpartialzz}
\end{equation}
The solution to \cref{eq:linearvariational}:
\begin{equation}
    \partial\qbar(t)=\frac{\partial\qbar(t)}{\partial\qbar_{0}}\partial\qbar_{0},
    \label{eq:variationalsolution}
\end{equation}
can be rearranged to provide the STM $\Phi(t,t_{0})$:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi(t,t_{0})=\frac{\partial\qbar(t)}{\partial\qbar_{{0}}}.
    \label{eq:STM}
\end{equation}
The equation of motion for the STM can be appended to the CR3BP equations of motion when
propagating:
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\Phi}(t,t_{0})=A(t)\Phi(t,t_{0}),
    \label{eq:STMEoM}
\end{equation}
where the initial condition is $\Phi(t_{0},t_{0})=I_{6\times6}$.

\subsection{Multi-Variable Newton-Raphson Method}
Targeting problems require iterative approaches where an initial guess is updated until it meets a
set of constraints to solve a boundary value problem. This investigation uses a multi-variable
Newton-Raphson method as a differential corrections process for single-shooting targeting problems,
applying analytical or numerical partial derivatives of constraints with respect to the initial
conditions.

If $\Xbar$ is the free variable vector and $\Fbar(\Xbar)$ is the constraint vector, dependent on
the free variables, then the goal of the targeting problem is to find $\Xbar$ such that
$\Fbar(\Xbar)=\zerobar$ (to a chosen tolerance). Example free variable and constraint vectors will
be introduced in future sections of this chapter and document. Under the Newton-Raphson method, the
update equation is again provided by a first-order Taylor series expansion about the initial
condition $\Xbar_{0}$:
\begin{equation}
    \Fbar(\Xbar)=\Fbar(\Xbar_{0})+DF(\Xbar_{0})(\Xbar-\Xbar_{0})=\zerobar,
    \label{eq:updateequation}
\end{equation}
where $DF(\Xbar)$ is the Jacobian matrix containing the partial derivatives of the constraint
vector with respect to the free variable vector.

With this update equation, the next iteration on the initial conditions can be computed. If the
number of free variables matches the number of constraints:
\begin{equation}
    \Xbar=\Xbar_{0}-DF(\Xbar_{0})^{-1}\Fbar(\Xbar_{0}),
    \label{eq:NRsolution}
\end{equation}
and this becomes the new iteration of the initial conditions. Ideally, upon each iteration, the
norm of the constraint vector should approach closer to the tolerance. If the number of free
variables is greater than the number of constraints, a minimum-norm solution can be used:
\begin{equation}
    \Xbar=\Xbar_{0}-DF(\Xbar_{0})^{T}(DF(\Xbar_{0})DF(\Xbar_{0})^{T})^{-1}\Fbar(\Xbar_{0}).
    \label{eq:minimumnorm}
\end{equation}
When the number of free variables is less than the number of constraints, a least squares solution
can be used, but that is not addressed in this investigation.

As a simple targeting example, consider the following planar boundary value problem in
\cref{fig:targeting}. The objective is to vary the initial velocity and time-of-flight (TOF) to
target a desired final position $\rhobar_{d}$. This results in a free variable vector:
\begin{equation}
    \Xbar=\begin{bmatrix}   \xdot_{0}   &   \ydot_{0}   &   \tau    \end{bmatrix}^{T},
    \label{eq:exfreevar}
\end{equation}
and constraint vector:
\begin{equation}
    \Fbar(\Xbar)=\begin{bmatrix}    x_{f}-x_{d} &   y_{f}-y_{d} \end{bmatrix}^{T}=\zerobar.
    \label{eq:exconst}
\end{equation}
The Jacobian matrix is comprised of the partial derivatives of the constraint vector with respect
to the free variable vector, in this case, a combination of the STM and time derivatives:
\begin{equation}
    DF(\Xbar)=\begin{bmatrix}   \frac{\partial(x_{f}-x_{d})}{\partial\xdot_{0}} &   \frac{\partial(x_{f}-x_{d})}{\partial\ydot_{0}} &   \frac{\partial(x_{f}-x_{d})}{\partial\tau}  \\
                                \frac{\partial(y_{f}-y_{d})}{\partial\xdot_{0}} &   \frac{\partial(y_{f}-y_{d})}{\partial\ydot_{0}} &   \frac{\partial(y_{f}-y_{d})}{\partial\tau}  \end{bmatrix}
             =\begin{bmatrix}   \phi_{14}                                       &   \phi_{15}                                       &   \xdot_{f}                                   \\
                                \phi_{24}                                       &   \phi_{25}                                       &   \ydot_{f}                                   \end{bmatrix},
    \label{eq:exJacobian}
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ are elements of the STM of the propagated arc. These vectors and the Jacobian matrix
can then be used in \cref{eq:minimumnorm} to iteratively solve for the free variable vector that
satisfies the constraint vector and solves the provided boundary value problem.

\subsection{Central Difference Method}
The Newton-Raphson method uses partial derivatives to solve a targeting problem iteratively. These
partial derivatives can be provided analytically (like in the previous example) or numerically
using an approximation method such as central differencing. The numerical approach is used in this
investigation to check analytical partial derivatives or when the analytical partials are overly
complicated.

The central difference method approximates the slope of the solution at discretized points just
before and after the initial condition:
\begin{equation}
    D\Fbar_{i}(\Xbar_{0})=\frac{\partial\Fbar(\Xbar_{0})}{\partial X_{i}}=\frac{\Fbar(X_{i}+\kappa)-\Fbar(X_{i}-\kappa)}{2\kappa},
    \label{eq:slope}
\end{equation}
where $X_{i}$ is one of the components of the free variable vector and $\kappa$ is a small
perturbation (this investigation uses the square root of the machine tolerance, $\sqrt{\epsilon}$).
Each variable in the free variable vector is perturbed in both directions by $\kappa$, one at a
time, and the constraint vector is evaluated at each new free variable vector and substituted into
\cref{eq:slope} above. Perturbing all of the free variables individually makes up the numerical
Jacobian matrix:
\begin{equation}
    DF(\Xbar_{0})=\begin{bmatrix}   D\Fbar_{1}(\Xbar_{0})   &   \dots   &   D\Fbar_{m}(\Xbar_{0})\end{bmatrix}.
    \label{eq:centraldifference}
\end{equation}
These numerical $DF$ matrices can be compared to their analytical counterparts (such as the example
Jacobian in \cref{eq:exJacobian}) to verify partial derivatives or applied in isolation when
analytical partial derivatives are either not available or exceedingly complex.
