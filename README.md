# purdue-aae-simple-tex-thesis
A simpler implementation of the Purdue official LaTeX thesis template, allowing for easier local compilation (currently specifically to AAE for simplicity)

The folders are named so that when listed alphabetically, the ordering makes sense (a-template, b-front, ch-chapters, d-back).


Note that this is still a work-in-progress, so while it does currently function, it is subject to future changes as I continue work on it.




### To Do:
    - Not sure if all the contents of `packages` are needed
    - Could maybe remove some of the validation code form the build version of the cls file
