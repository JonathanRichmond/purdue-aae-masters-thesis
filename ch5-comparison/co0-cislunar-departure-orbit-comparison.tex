\chapter{CISLUNAR DEPARTURE ORBIT COMPARISON}

The two approaches introduced in the previous chapter for designing end-to-end transfers from the
cislunar region to Mars generate families of transfers from various departure unstable periodic
orbits in Earth-Moon CR3BP families. For given departure orbits, the transfers that stage
in an intermediate Sun-Earth halo orbit are compared to the transfers with direct departures from
the Sun-Earth system to determine any potential benefits of a staging orbit. A cost function is
introduced to aid in the selection of desirable transfers in each transfer group. Then the selected
transfers are compared across the various cislunar departure orbits to analyze the departure
characteristics across orbit families and energy levels. Finally, the total maneuver $\Delta v$
and TOF costs of the transfer strategies developed in this investigation are compared to existing
literature and methodologies to demonstrate that this approach reduces the maneuver costs for a
Mars mission.
