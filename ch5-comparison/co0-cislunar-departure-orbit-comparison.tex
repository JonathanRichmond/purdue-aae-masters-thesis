\chapter{CISLUNAR DEPARTURE ORBIT COMPARISON}

The two approaches introduced in the previous chapter for designing end-to-end transfers from the
cislunar region to Mars are used to generate families of transfers from various departure periodic
orbits in Earth-Moon CR3BP unstable families. For given departure orbits, the transfers that stage
in an intermediate Sun-Earth halo orbit are compared to the "direct" transfers to determine the
usefulness of a staging orbit. A cost function is introduced to select desirable transfers in each
family. Then these are compared across the various cislunar departure orbits to analyze trends in
the departure characteristics across orbit families and energy levels. Finally, the maneuver
$\Delta v$ and TOF costs of the transfer strategies developed in this investigation are compared to
existing literature and methodologies to show that this approach reduces the maneuver costs for a
Mars mission.
