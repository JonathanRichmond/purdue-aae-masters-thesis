\section{Comparing Transfers via Intermediate Sun-Earth Halos to Direct Transfers}
Just like the example tradespace provided in Section 4.3.3, with \cref{fig:tradespace}, for a given
cislunar departure orbit, the "direct" transfers are compared to those that stage in an
intermediate Sun-Earth unstable halo orbit. Tradespaces for all of the departure orbits used in
this investigation are provided in Appendix A, but a few will be introduced in this section to
better facilitate the comparison.
