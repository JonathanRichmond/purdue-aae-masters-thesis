\chapter{CISLUNAR-MARS TRAJECTORY CONSTRUCTION}

Many of the techniques introduced in the previous chapter are used in this investigation to design
end-to-end transfers between orbits in the Earth-Moon and Sun-Mars CR3BP systems. Two categories of
transfers are designed and compared: trajectories that include an intermediate Sun-Earth staging
halo orbit and those that do not. For the transfers utilizing a staging orbit, a strategy is
adapted from Kakoi to compute near-ballistic transfer solutions between Earth-Moon unstable orbits
and Sun-Earth halos via invariant manifolds\cite{Kakoi:2015}. Both sets of transfers then use a
variation of the moon-to-moon analytical transfer methodology developed by Canales to bridge the
gap between the Sun-Earth trajectories (either Sun-Earth manifolds or Earth-Moon manifolds
propagated under Sun-Earth dynamics) and the Sun-Mars manifolds\cite{Canales:2021b}. Note that this
transfer design process may not result in optimized interplanertary transfers, but instead provides
families of low-energy solutions to facilitate the comparison between cislunar departure orbits. As
a baseline comparison metric, a Keplerian Hohmann transfer with a built-in plane change is also
introduced here to represent the current standard for non-coplanar direct Earth-Mars transfers.
