\chapter{DYNAMICAL MODELS}

In the cislunar and other multi-body environments, the gravitational accelerations from one or more
masses can affect spacecraft trajectories simultaneously, depending on their proximity to the
vehicle. Multiple dynamical models are available to describe the spacecraft behavior; however, as
the fidelity of the models increases, so does their complexity. Consequently, the appropriate
dynamical model for a given application is a balance between accuracy and simplicity. This
investigation is based on two primary dynamical models: The relative 2-Body Problem (2BP) and the
Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem (CR3BP). The 2BP serves as a model for spacecraft dynamics when
its behavior is well-represented by assuming it is solely governed by the gravitational influence
of a single body, primarily applied to heliocentric arcs along a trajectory. In cases where the
dynamics are significantly influenced by the gravitational forces of two bodies, for example, in
Sun-planet or the Earth-Moon systems, the CR3BP offers a more accurate description of the
spacecraft behavior while remaining simple enough to provide insight into the general dynamics.
