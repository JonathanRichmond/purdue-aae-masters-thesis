\chapter{DYNAMICAL MODELS}

This analysis relies on the utilization of two primary dynamical models: The Two-Body Problem (2BP)
and the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). The 2BP serves as a model for spacecraft
dynamics when their motion is solely governed by the gravitational influence of a single body,
primarily applied to the study of heliocentric arcs within this investigation. In cases where the
dynamics are significantly influenced by the gravitational forces of two bodies, as exemplified in
Sun-planet or the Earth-Moon systems, the CR3BP offers a more accurate description of the
spacecraft's motion.
