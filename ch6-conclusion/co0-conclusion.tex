\chapter{CONCLUDING REMARKS}
For humanity to develop and maintain a constant presence at Mars and other deep space locations, a
comprehensive understanding of multi-body dynamical systems theory and departure dynamics within
cislunar space is critical for trajectory design. This investigation develops a methodology for
designing transfers from unstable cislunar periodic orbits to deep space targets utilizing
invariant manifolds in the CR3BP. By applying dynamical systems theory, this design approach can
link multiple CR3BP systems for end-to-end transfers that exist in families of solutions, allowing
for more flexible mission designs. Additionally, in this investigation, various unstable cislunar
periodic orbit families are analyzed in the context of these interplanetary transfers to evaluate
their departure characteristics. The result is an improved understanding of invariant manifold
departure behavior in the Earth-Moon CR3BP, as well as a catalog of Mars transfer tradespaces. The
end-to-end transfer maneuver costs are consistent with those from previous investigations and
better than traditional approaches, although they come with increased times-of-flight. This
section will summarize the main contributions of this investigation and provide several
recommendations for future work.

\section{Investigation Summary}
\subsection{Low-Energy Cislunar-to-Mars Transfer Design Methodology}
Unstable periodic orbits in the CR3BP possess unstable and stable invariant manifolds that
asymptotically depart from or arrive onto the orbit. Arcs from these manifolds can be utilized to
construct ballistic transfers starting or terminating at these orbits. However, in the context of
interplanetary and deep space transfers, the energy gaps between invariant manifolds of different
systems prevent direct connections between these manifolds, dictating the need for bridging arcs
or alternative strategies. The end-to-end cislunar-to-Mars transfer design methodology developed in
this investigation patches two planetary manifold arcs together with a heliocentric Keplerian
bridging arc using the MMAT approach. Since this bridging leg of the trajectory is sufficiently far
away from both the Earth and Mars, the Sun's gravity is the dominating force considered, allowing
for a simplified model (the 2BP) and a semi-analytical method to compute this part of the transfer.
This approach is also able to incorporate the true planes of motion of the Earth and Mars,
resulting in a slightly higher fidelity for this patched 2BP-CR3BP model.

In addition to the MMAT methodology, some end-to-end transfers constructed in this investigation
stage in an intermediate $L_{2}$ halo orbit in the Sun-Earth CR3BP. Those solutions rely on
near-ballistic connections between unstable Earth-Moon and stable Sun-Earth invariant manifold arcs
for low-cost transfers in a blended CR3BP model. The solutions that directly depart the system
instead, without connecting to a staging orbit, still rely on this blended model, transitioning
from one CR3BP system to the other after exiting the Moon's sphere of influence. The successful
meshing of the blended CR3BP and patched 2BP-CR3BP dynamical models facilitates the end-to-end
transfers between Earth-Moon and Sun-Mars CR3BP periodic orbits.

Another major benefit of this new transfer methodology is that the transfers exist in families of
solutions. Through the exploitation of dynamical systems theory, there are a variety of ways to
continue the family of solutions. Each solution tradespace for the orbits used in this
investigation, supplied in Appendix A, shows families of transfer solutions continued by varying
the unstable departure manifold or the initial departure epoch. New families could also be
generated by varying the stable arrival manifold onto the Sun-Mars halo orbit or the Jacobi
constant of the intermediate staging orbit. By not relying on individual point solutions that have
to be recomputed whenever a parameter changes, this developed transfer methodology offers improved
mission design flexibility while also providing a broader view of the design tradespace.

\subsection{Intermediate Sun-Earth Staging Halo Orbits}
Since unstable invariant manifolds asymptotically depart from periodic orbits, the cislunar
manifold arcs can take a long time to depart from the Earth-Moon system. Once they do, they are
also propagated under the Sun-Earth dynamics until they leave the Earth's SoI. In some cases, the
unstable invariant manifolds from Sun-Earth periodic orbits depart the Earth region with more
desirable characteristics. Therefore, for each cislunar departure orbit analyzed in this
investigation, transfers with direct manifold departures from the system are compared to those that
stage in an intermediate Sun-Earth $L_{2}$ northern halo orbit.

In the context of the end-to-end transfer methodology developed in this investigation, it is shown
that the direct departure transfers perform better overall than those that utilize a staging orbit
in terms of total maneuver $\Delta v$ cost and TOF. While staging orbit transfers for a few of the
selected orbits can achieve a slightly lower average $\Delta v$, the direct transfers have lower
times-of-flight in every case analyzed. The TOF decrease can be on the order of $1$ year compared
to around $0.1$ km/s in maneuver savings. This conclusion is reinforced by the cost function
analysis of the transfers, where all of the direct transfer families have lower cost function
values than those with staging orbits. Therefore, in this investigation, the transfers that
directly depart the Earth system are shown to outperform those that stage in an intermediate
Sun-Earth halo orbit in terms of TOF and often maneuver cost as well.

\subsection{Cislunar Departure Characteristics}
Each cislunar departure orbit included in this investigation provides families of solutions,
evaluated in a tradespace between total maneuver $\Delta v$ and total TOF. For each tradespace, a
cost function is used to determine the ten best orbits in each family (staging orbit and direct)
based on mission design preferences. In this investigation, parameters are chosen such that
decreases in TOF are valued more highly than decreases in $\Delta v$. The characteristics of these
ten best transfers are compared between the different cislunar departure orbits to identify trends
in characteristics across families and energy levels.

Across both types of transfers developed in this investigation, the location of the second MMAT
maneuver, which includes the orbit inclination change, is the dominating factor for total
$\Delta v$ cost. The closer this burn occurs to the periapsis of the heliocentric bridge conic arc,
the lower the maneuver cost. Additionally, in the case of transfers that directly depart the Earth
system, invariant manifold arcs that exit near the Sun-Earth $L_{2}$ point provide the
minimum-$\Delta v$ solutions in the family. The main contributing factor for lowering total
transfer TOF is the relative phasing of the Keplerian conic arcs. When the true anomaly of the
arrival conic arc at the Mars SoI intersection is just after the intersection of the bridge and
arrival conic arcs, this minimizes the arrival conic arc TOF and therefore the total transfer TOF.
The minimum-TOF solutions in the families occur when the invariant manifold arcs exit near the
Sun-Earth $L_{1}$ Lagrange point, although the best transfers that balance the two parameters still
exit from $L_{2}$.

In terms of maneuver cost, the $L_{1}$ halo and vertical orbit families, as well as the $L_{2}$
axial orbit family, provide the best options for staging orbit transfers. For the transfers with
direct departures, the $L_{1}$ Lyapunov and halo orbit families result in the lowest-$\Delta v$
transfer options. The $L_{1}$ family departures leverage close passes by the Moon to lessen the
planetary system energy gap between invariant manifold arcs. When it comes to the transfer TOF,
staging orbit $L_{2}$ Lyapunov and halo orbit families perform the best, while $L_{2}$ halo, axial,
and butterfly orbit families have the fastest direct transfers. The $L_{2}$ orbit families often
have invariant manifolds that depart the Earth-Moon system faster and extend further than the
$L_{1}$ orbit families. Using the cost function to find a balance between $\Delta v$ and TOF, this
investigation identifies that transfers from the $L_{2}$ Lyapunov, halo, and vertical orbit
families with direct departures perform well at various Jacobi constant levels. The best cislunar
departure orbit identified in this investigation is the $3.13$ $L_{2}$ Lyapunov orbit, whose best
transfers have an average maneuver cost of $5.282$ km/s and TOF of $3.92$ years.

Using the two interplanetary transfer methodologies developed in this investigation, all of the
included cislunar departure orbits have staging orbit and direct transfers with total maneuver
costs that are up to $1$ km/s less than the traditional Earth-Mars interplanetary transfer methods.
And while the times-of-flight of these transfers are significantly longer than traditional
interplanetary transfers due to the exploitation of invariant manifolds, the transfers in this
investigation with direct departures can save up to $1$ year compared to the staging orbit
transfers. The transfers developed in this investigation confirm that invariant manifold arcs can
be used to decrease interplanetary transfer maneuver costs and highlight a few cislunar orbit
families with more desirable departure characteristics.

\section{Recommendations for Future Work}
With increasing interest in interplanetary missions and the use of dynamic systems theory in
trajectory design, there are many potential avenues of research to build off the work done in this
investigation. A few promising options are presented here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Continue this analysis with cislunar departure orbits in a broader Jacobi
            constant range and transfers to other deep space targets.}

            In the current investigation, cislunar departure orbits were limited to a Jacobi
            constant range of $2.98$-$3.13$. Many potentially useful unstable orbits and orbit
            families in the Earth-Moon CR3BP exist at Jacobi constant values below that range.
            Additionally, there are many families of resonant and period-multiplying orbits that
            were not examined in this investigation. A complete analysis of cislunar departure
            dynamics from unstable orbits would require an extension of the current analysis to
            these other orbits. This investigation also limited its scope by using a Sun-Mars
            $L_{1}$ northern halo as its arrival destination. The methodologies developed here
            are applicable for any unstable CR3BP arrival orbit and should be verified using
            other arrival periodic orbits in other CR3BP systems such as Venus or large asteroids. 
    \item   \textbf{Investigate how dynamical systems theory and invariant manifolds can be
            incorporated into other interplanetary transfer design methodologies and optimization.}

            This investigation used a combination of near-ballistic Earth-Moon to Sun-Earth
            transfers and the MMAT methodology to design interplanetary transfers, but this is by
            far not the only way to incorporate multi-body dynamical systems theory into trajectory
            design. Many other strategies exist that incorporate intentional Earth or Moon flybys
            or additional or differently placed maneuvers. It is very possible that some of these
            methodologies could offer transfers with lower times-of-flight than those computed in
            this investigation. The transfers presented here, while they exist in families, are
            also not optimized solutions. Therefore, an exploration of other transfer methodologies
            that includes trajectory optimization is necessary to continue to improve
            interplanetary mission design.
    \item   \textbf{Explore cislunar departure dynamics from stable CR3BP orbits.}
    
            Unstable cislunar departure and arrival orbits are exclusively used in this
            investigation to exploit their invariant manifolds for ballistic departures and
            arrivals. Unfortunately, the methodologies developed do not apply to stable CR3BP
            orbits so other dynamical systems theory techniques are required. The utilization of
            maneuvers along stretching directions is a promising approach for stable orbit
            departure and could be applied as an alternative to invariant manifold arcs with the
            MMAT method. Muralidharan and Howell show the usefulness of such an approach and some
            applications within cislunar space\cite{Muralidharan:2022}.
    \item   \textbf{Employ higher-fidelity dynamical models to confirm the results of this
            investigation and further explore cislunar departure dynamics.}

            Since the gravitational effects of the Earth, Moon, and Sun are all considered at
            various points throughout the models employed in this investigation, it would be
            beneficial to incorporate a 4-body model such as the BCR4BP. There is precedent for
            using this model to explore cislunar departure dynamics, and it would also simplify the
            construction of transfers between the Earth-Moon and Sun-Earth systems, as well as
            better facilitate the relative phasing between the celestial
            bodies\cite{Boudad:2021,Boudad:2022}. The inclusion of the Sun's gravitational
            influence would also aid in the departure from stable cislunar orbits using
            pseudo-manifolds that stem from the inclusion of the Sun in the dynamical model.
            Finally, while the BCR4BP does provide a higher-fidelity dynamical model to further
            explore departure dynamics and interplanetary transfers, the results of this
            investigation, as well as all of those proposed in this future work section, need to be
            validated in the high-fidelity ephemeris model. This will ensure that the transfer
            geometries persist under a more accurate representation of the dynamics while also
            providing insight into feasible launch dates and windows in the near future for these
            types of interplanetary transfers. That is the necessary next step for these transfers
            to be applied to real mission scenarios.
